      <h1>Community Science Museum</h1>
      <h2>“Explore together”</h2>
      Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
      making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history,
      science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water,
      and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very
      building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to create a space
      where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps
      even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world
      around us. We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
      brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
      exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these
      exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see
      science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to
      life at night when everyone’s gone home).

      <h2>Explore</h2>

      <h2>For kids</h2>
      Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down
      to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about Newtonian
      physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our
      resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
      interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore. We
      also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday
      between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with
      our team of experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday
      clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
      discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
      about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

      <h2>For teachers</h2>
      As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
      places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
      students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
      laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
      inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
      facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a
      visit.

      <h2>Researchers</h2>
      Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
      academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our resources and
      contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and a
      working relationship with a number of universities around the country.
